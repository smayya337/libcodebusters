# libcodebusters

`libcodebusters` is my attempt at programming a variety of cipher encode and decode methods!

Here's what it can do:

|Encrypt|Decrypt|
|:--:|:--:|
|Affine|Affine|
|Aristocrat|Atbash|
|Atbash|Caesar|
|Caesar|Hill|
|Hill|Rail Fence|
|Patristocrat|Vigenere|
|Rail Fence|
|Vigenere|

I used the `numpy` and `sympy` libraries to create `libcodebusters`.

I'm always trying to add new features! If you have a cipher that you'd like to see me include, let me know and I'll give it a shot.
