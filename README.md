# libcodebusters

`libcodebusters` is my attempt at programming a variety of cipher encode and decode methods!

Here's what it can do:

|Encrypt|Decrypt|
|:--:|:--:|
|Affine|Affine|
|Aristocrat|Atbash|
|Atbash|Caesar|
|Baconian|Hill|
|Caesar|Rail Fence|
|Hill|Vigenere|
|Patristocrat|
|Rail Fence|
|Vigenere|

I used the `numpy` and `sympy` libraries to create `libcodebusters`.

I'm always trying to add new features! If you have a cipher that you'd like to see me include, let me know and I'll give it a shot.
In addition, I'm aware that these methods may not be very efficient - if you have an idea for improving the performance of this code, tell me about it.
